# Suno Architect - Auto Generate Suno Prompts
- Uses Gemini Flash 2.5 or 3.0 flash (which supports free keys, see [https://aistudio.google.com/api-keys](https://aistudio.google.com/api-keys))

## Featues

### Generation
- Generates
  - Song title
  - Suno style settings (weirdness %, style %, exclude, and male/female/none)
  - Lyrics including Suno style tags
  - JavaScript pastable into console on Suno create page (autofills everything)
  - Lyrics without tags, copy pastable for elsewhere. Also used via the API below to remove tags in displayed lyrics.
- **OPTIONAL:** Utilises Suno API
  - Requires an easily obtainable token (which may expire at times)
  - Adds a button to send directly to the Suno API
  - Saves ID in 'history' tab to display image(s), links to suno tracks, download buttons, song metadata (BPM, explicit, prompt details), etc
  - Support for pulling the timed lyrics from Suno
  - Support for conversion of timed lyrics JSON to LRC or SRT
  - NOTE: _For some reason the main generation API is cors locked, requiring the worker. The rest is direct via browser)_
- **OPTIONAL:** Use of files for prompts
  - Audio files for style influencing
  - Image files to influence lyrics vibe
  - PDF or text files to influence lore (background)
 
### LRC and SRT File Generation

- Pulls lyics from Suno API
- Times word-time lyrics line-by-line, exportable as SRT or LRC

### Lyric Video Generation
- Pulls JSON word-by-word lyrics from Suno API for highlighting active word
- Pulls lyrics (prompt) from Suni API for line generation
- Live preview available with various settings
- Exportable to webm

## Deploy with Cloudflare
[![Deploy to Cloudflare](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/xiliourt/Suno-Architect/)
- Requires the worker to forward Suno generation requests and avoid cors issues, all other API end points seem to work fine.

## Credits
- [https://github.com/gcui-art/suno-api/](https://github.com/gcui-art/suno-api/) has reverse engineered most of the API already, so I didn't need to do it myself. Only took some tweaking, none of the code is directly use but it sure helped speeding up understanding the API. Also has interfaces and types to know what response to expect from the API - very helpful.
